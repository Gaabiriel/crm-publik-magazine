# Angular and .NET Framework Project with DDD Architecture

## Overview

This project combines Angular 9 for the frontend and .NET Framework 4.8 for the backend, utilizing a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture. The frontend is built using the ngx-admin-bundle template for Angular, providing a robust and customizable UI framework. The backend is developed with .NET Framework, specifically employing a Web API for handling server-side logic and data processing.

## Features

- **Angular Frontend**: Utilizes Angular 9 with ngx-admin-bundle template, offering a modern and responsive user interface.
- **.NET Framework Backend**: Implements a Web API using .NET Framework 4.8, providing a stable and scalable backend solution.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Adopts DDD principles to organize the application structure around domain concepts, promoting better maintainability and flexibility.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Ensures clear separation between frontend and backend logic, enabling independent development and easier maintenance.
- **Scalability**: Designed to accommodate scalability requirements, allowing the application to handle increased load and growing data volumes effectively.
